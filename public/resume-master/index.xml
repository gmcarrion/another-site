      <description>RMarkdown resume/CV template Based on templates by svmiller and ryanpeek. The only two files that are required to run the RMarkdown is cv-template.Rmd and cv-template.tex, which should be stored in the same directory.
What you write in the fields is completely customizable if you know some Markdown. How you format the document requires LaTeX.</description>
