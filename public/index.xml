      <description>RMarkdown resume/CV template Based on templates by svmiller and ryanpeek. The only two files that are required to run the RMarkdown is cv-template.Rmd and cv-template.tex, which should be stored in the same directory.
What you write in the fields is completely customizable if you know some Markdown. How you format the document requires LaTeX.</description>

      <description>This is a data frame with 1295 rows and 10 columns. The data set contains information about the mortality outcomes for females suffering myocardial infarction. A myocradial infarction is a heart attack and I will refer to it as that throughout the project. It contains a binary variable, ‘outcome’ in which the patient either lived or died. The data set contains 2 numerical variable,‘age’ the age of the onset of theheart attack, and ‘yronset’ the year of the onset of the heart attack.</description>
